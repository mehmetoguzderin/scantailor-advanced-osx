# scantailor-advanced-osx
Homebrew formula and App bundler for Scantailor (Advanced). Now uses Qt6 framework.

See [4lex4/scantailor-advanced](https://github.com/4lex4/scantailor-advanced) for the original project.
The project seems to be abandoned, this formula now fetches from the fork [vigri/scantailor-advanced](https://github.com/vigri/scantailor-advanced)

## Installing via homebrew ##

### Install script ###

All automated, execute in your terminal :
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehmetoguzderin/scantailor-advanced-osx/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This script tries to install `brew` and `git` if missing. It may ask you to install the command-line developper tools.
If both these utilities are present, it clones this repository and install the homebrew formula.

To install the `HEAD` and not the latest release run

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehmetoguzderin/scantailor-advanced-osx/HEAD/install.sh)" install --HEAD

```

### Manual Install  ###


1. clone the repository
```
git clone "https://github.com/mehmetoguzderin/scantailor-advanced-osx.git"
cd ./scantailor-advanced-osx
```

2. with [homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed and updated, run :

```
brew install --formula ./scantailor.rb
```
Compilation takes time, you can inspect the logs for more details at `~/Library/Logs/Homebrew/scantailor` with OS X Console.

You should now be able to run Scantailor from the command-line : `scantailor`

You can get the bleeding edge instead of a released version with the `--HEAD` flag :

```
brew install --formula --HEAD ./scantailor.rb
```

## Bundling your binary
To use the bundler, you need the fish shell (`brew install fish`) and the utility macdeployqt to do the linking (installed with qt6). 

1. make sure that QT is correctly linked : `brew link --force qt6`
2. add the QT bin folder to your fish path : `echo 'set -g fish_user_paths "/usr/local/opt/qt/bin" $fish_user_paths' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish`
3. Simply run `bundler/scantailor_bundler.command` (you may have to `chmod 755 bundler/scantailor_bundler.command`)

The bundler script will use the scantailor binary which is in your shell path (the value printed out by `which scantailor`).
